Hello!

I have been able to create a basic virtual ansible lab to build upon during this course. My lab consists of an ESXI server running a number of Virtual Machines.
I have the following virtual machines/roles"


	1. Ubuntu 16.04 VM - This is runnig Ansible and Git
	2. Juniper vMX Router #1  (in the inventory of the ansible 'hosts' file)
	3. Juniper VMX Router #2  (in the inventory of the ansible 'hosts' file)


The Ubuntu server has a connection into the "management" network of my two vMX routers, and that is how it is logging into them via SSH.
I am probably going to add a vSRX to my lab topology, and possibly a Cumulus Linux box or two. I have two virtual VyOS routers that I may decide to bring into 
the topology as well.


Looking forward to the rest of the class!

-STEVE
